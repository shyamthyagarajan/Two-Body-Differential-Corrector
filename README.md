# Two-Body-Differential-Corrector
Generates a two-body orbit fixed around the Sun and allows user input for the orbiting body; utilizing an initial guess for the keplerian set of elements of the orbit, a differential correction process is iteratively applied to correct the error difference between the initial guess and the actual value
